City Slots Prototype

This is my third project for Tiny Mass Games. Tiny Mass Games is a game dev collective focused on building polished short-form games in a two-month time-span.

City Slots is meant to be a cross between the roguelike slots game Luck Be a Landlord and the tiny city building The Block. This repo is the game after one week's worth of development. It has the basics of the system in: building selection, building placement, symbol generation, and symbol interaction with buildings as the symbols "fall through" five layers of the city. There are only four buildings and two symbols included so far, but this project should demonstrate how new buildings or symbols would fit in.

This is being released under the MIT license, and other game devs (and other TMG devs) may find it helpful on getting started making a game.

This project started off with Kenney's City Builder Starter Kit (https://github.com/KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-City-Builder). Love Kenney and his work, it's been extremely valuable to me as a game dev.
